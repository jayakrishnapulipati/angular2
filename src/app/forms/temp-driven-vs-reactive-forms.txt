template driven forms

we could not able to test the form validation logic from end to end.
for larger forms it's really hard to find out the error which it was occured
    and may take time for to find out the solution.
the form elements model will be set automatically using the ng-model directive and
    we can keep the reference to respective form elements as well as @ the form level
	for to find out the form states.



model/reactve driven forms

we able to test the form validation logic from end to end.
for larger forms it's easy to find out the error which it was occured
    and may take time for to find out the solution.
There are two ways of applying validations
   using low level API called formgroups and formcontrols
   using high level API	called formbuilders

   for to use these two types of validations have to import reactiveFormsModule,
   formGroup, formControl and Validatators respectively.

For this the model have to set by ourselfs using the formgroup and builders.
